    <ContextTitle>About the organisation</ContextTitle>
    <ContextContent>
      <Paragraph>The Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Corporation is a statutory body established under the <Source>Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments (Amendment) Act 1982</Source>.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The effect of the Act was to transfer the administration of a portable long service payments scheme for building and construction workers in NSW from the Builders Licensing Board to the Corporation. Between 1975 and 1982, the long service payments scheme was a division within the former Builders Licensing Board (now part of the Office of Fair Trading).</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The purpose of the Corporation is to manage an independent and impartial worker benefit scheme providing industry-based portability of long service benefits for designated members of the building and construction industry in NSW. The Corporation:<List><Item>registers building and construction industry workers</Item><Item>collects service details from employers and workers, and issues notices of service to workers annually, and</Item><Item>provides long service payments to eligible members.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation also collects levies on building and construction work to fund the scheme.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Prior to 1986 the scheme was funded by a charge on employers. From July 1986, the Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1986 provided that the funding would come from a levy on building and construction work. The levy is currently 0.2% on building and construction work costing $25 000 or more, with most local councils acting as agents to collect the levy for the Corporation.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation consists of two branches. The Operations branch is responsible for:<List><Item>scheme compliance</Item><Item>customer services, and</Item><Item>register maintenance.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Support branch is responsible for:<List><Item>information technology</Item><Item>levy collection, finance and compliance</Item><Item>support services, and</Item><Item>records management.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>There is also a Policy, Development and Committee Support section.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation currently employs approximately 65 staff (full time equivalent).</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation is responsible for the administration of the <Source>Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1986</Source>, which requires it to deliver a long service payments scheme to the building and construction industry of NSW. This Act also defines how the scheme is to be administered and how it is to be managed.</Paragraph>

    <ContextTitle>About relationships with other organisations and stakeholders</ContextTitle>
    <ContextContent>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation's operations depend on the services of local councils for the collection of levies. The Corporation has no subsidiaries, and has not entered into joint ventures or partnerships with other organisations.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation provides a service to over 251,000 registered active building and construction workers, and liaises with more than 32,500 registered employers.</Paragraph>

    <ContextTitle>About committees</ContextTitle>
    <ContextContent>
      <Paragraph>The <Source>Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1986</Source> provides for a Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Committee (the 'Industry Committee'), which acts as an advisory and appellate body. The Industry Committee consists of ten part-time members appointed by the Minister.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Industry Committee is empowered under s.9 of the Act to advise the Corporation on administration of the Act, including matters concerning publicity, the investment of funds and the rate of the long service levy. The Industry Committee decides worker's appeals lodged against decisions of the Corporation, and decides appeals lodged by levy payers. It also acts as a 'Customer Council' in relation to customer service standards and helps to ensure that the quality and effectiveness of services meet customers' needs.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation is able to provide the building and construction industry with regular updates on its services/achievements and consult with industry representatives on any issues affecting its operations via the Industry Committee.</Paragraph>

    <ContextTitle>About the records held by the organisation</ContextTitle>
    <ContextContent>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation has implemented an electronic document and records management system. The system integrates with other business solutions, and facilitates the management of paper and electronic communications records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation has also started a major redevelopment of its computerised Worker Registry System. This redevelopment will replace a 20 year-old system and accords with Government Requirements for open platform systems. It will provide greater flexibility and will also allow for more streamlined lodgement of information by employers and will include Internet transacting.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation's oldest records date back to the beginning of the scheme in 1975, and were created by the Builders Licensing Board.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Corporation manages records relating to the registration of and administration of payments to employers and workers as case files, and currently has approximately 380 000 worker files and 83 000 employer files.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>A number of disposal recommendations have been issued to the Corporation in the past: DR2886, DR3001, DR3060, DR3092, DR3267, DR3345, DR3458, DR3556, DR3794, DR4309, DR4380, DR4499, DR4542, DR5104, DR5406 and DR5500.
